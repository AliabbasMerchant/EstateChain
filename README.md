# EstateChain

A blockchain based solution to address the issues of Real Estate Management.   

A person goes to the government to get his property digitized.  
Each property gets divided into tokens, according to its area.  
People on the network can then invest in the property, by buying the tokens.
The whole property can then be rented by a person, for X number of days.  
The rent of the property is decided by the collective decision of all the investors in that property.  
Also, the rent is paid out, such that each investor gets an amount proportional to the percentage of shares he holds in that particular property.

### Advantages of such a system over the Existing Real Estate System:
* Faster
* Safer
* Cheaper
* Tokenization and liquidation of Real Estate Assets
* Fractional Ownership of Assets
* All the owners have a say in deciding the rent amount
* Equitable distribution of rent amount amongst the investors
